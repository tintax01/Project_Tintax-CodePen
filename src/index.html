<p> 
 Roughly two-thirds of the entire world's cocoa is produced in West Africa, with 43% sourced from CÃ´te d'Ivoire,[38] where, as of 2007, child labor is a common practice to obtain the product.[39][40] According to the World Cocoa Foundation, in 2007 some 50 million people around the world depended on cocoa as a source of livelihood.[41] As of 2007 in the UK, most chocolatiers purchase their chocolate from them, to melt, mold and package to their own design.[42] According to the WCF's 2012 report, the Ivory Coast is the largest producer of cocoa in the world.[43] The two main jobs associated with creating chocolate candy are chocolate makers and chocolatiers. Chocolate makers use harvested cacao beans and other ingredients to produce couverture chocolate (covering). Chocolatiers use the finished couverture to make chocolate candies (bars, truffles, etc.).[44]

Production costs can be decreased by reducing cocoa solids content or by substituting cocoa butter with another fat. Cocoa growers object to allowing the resulting food to be called "chocolate", due to the risk of lower demand for their crops.[41]</p>
